# nLightning Mind chrome extension

Chrome extension that is helping you focus.

There are so many annoying websites and there are tools 

It should be painful enough to build the habit of not visiting naughty websites.

Couple hundred satoshis per second, can customise depending on your goals.

I believe that flowing animation and ticking timer will stress you out and rewire your brain.

Ever since I’ve seen Andreas talk about Lightning Network and satoshis per second I thought it’s freaking revolutionary...


# Demo

# `video placeholder`


# Installation

Lightning network is unfairly cheap. Now it is unfairly easy to run your own node:

I need to cleanup at some point, `zepto.min.js` and `jquery.js`, `reset.css` and `normalize.css` are replacement equivalent: [en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_it_ain't_broke,_don't_fix_it](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_it_ain%27t_broke,_don%27t_fix_it)

# TODO:

* less happy path

There are so many potential onboarding pains

* save for later

Rationale:

Just by visiting the website and writing down what you want to accomplish is enough to realise it's not necessary

Batching requests


* Keep track of completed tasks

Rationale

In case of social media and sending message to someone, you may want periodically follow up


* Amazon affiliate, rewrting links 

Extra income, extra money

# Proof of Work
Not that long time ago all my knowledge related to Lightning Network was *"in can scale, crypto magic"*. Now I know a little bit more.
